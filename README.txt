This directory contains the necessary MATLAB code to replicate simulation results in 
"Natural Gradient Hybrid Variational Inference with Application to Deep Mixed Models"
Authors: Weiben Zhang, Michael Smith, Worapree Maneesoonthorn and Rub√©n Loaiza-Maya

Each folder contains MATLAB scripts to replicate the results and 
a 'Service functions' subfolder with necessary functions for the script.

The results presented in the paper were produced using MATLAB R2022a on a Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system, 
with a 2.50 GHz 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-11900 processor.
Two exceptions are the scripts 'Eg2_DeepGLMM_robust.m' and 'Eg3_DeepGLMM_robust.m', which were run on a high performance computation system (Spartan).
To run these two scripts on a standard computer, we recommend changing the 'parfor' loop to a 'for' loop to avoid out-of-memory errors.
